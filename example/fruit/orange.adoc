= Orange

An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list
of plants known as orange); it primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis, which
is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus ×
aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually
(apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through
mutations.
