= Luhmann

Luhmann is a lightweight link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten[Zettelkasten]
system written in Clojure. Luhmann runs as a web server that watches a directory
of Asciidoc files and provides the following features:

* A pre-rendered web site generated from the Asciidoc.
* A searchable index of all the files.
* A database of all the files, including tracking of backlinks.
* An HTTP/JSON API for querying the index and database.

== Motivation

I really wanted to start building my own Zettelkasten but I had already started
note-taking using Asciidoc and Neovim. I looked at
link:https://obsidian.md/[Obsidian] but I strongly prefer Asciidoc to Markdown
and editing text in Neovim to a web-based editor.
